# js-racer

### This is a project that I paried on with a friend that I thought was really cool, but didn't have a lot of time to work on. Currently, everything in this repo has not been improved upon (and is pretty awful now that I know better).

### I'm looking forward to working on this and giving it more of a personality, make it responsive, give it functionality to actually tally up scores, input player names, and add characters. At the very least, dat pikachu gif deserves better lol.
